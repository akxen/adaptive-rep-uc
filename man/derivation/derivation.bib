  abstract = {This paper provides the convex hull description for the basic operation of slow- and quick-start units in power-based unit commitment (UC) problems. The basic operating constraints that are modeled for both types of units are (1) generation limits and (2) minimum up and down times. Apart from this, the startup and shutdown processes are also modeled, using (3) startup and shutdown power trajectories for slow-start units, and (4) startup and shutdown capabilities for quick-start units. In the conventional UC problem, power schedules are used to represent the staircase energy schedule; however, this simplification leads to infeasible energy delivery, as stated in the literature. To overcome this drawback, this paper provides a power-based UC formulation drawing a clear distinction between power and energy. The proposed constraints can be used as the core of any power-based UC formulation, thus tightening the final mixed-integer programming UC problem. We provide evidence that dramatic improvements in computational time are obtained by solving different case studies, for self-UC and network-constrained UC problems.},

  abstract = {Intermittence and variability of renewable resources is often a barrier to their large scale integration into power systems. We propose a stochastic real-time unit commitment to deal with the stochasticity and intermittence of non-dispatchable renewable resources including ideal and generic energy storage devices. Firstly, we present a mathematical definition of an ideal and generic storage device. This storage device definition has some mathematical advantages: 1) it can be easily integrated within complex optimization problems, 2) it can be modeled using linear programming, suitable for practical large-scale cases. Secondly, a stochastic unit commitment with ideal and generic storage devices and intermittent generation is proposed to solve the joint energy-and-reserves scheduling and real-time power balance problem, reflecting the minute-by-minute intermittent changes and the stochasticity of renewable resources. We also compare our results with those obtained using a deterministic unit commitment with perfect information. The proposed model is illustrated with a 24-bus system.},

  title = {Computationally {{Efficient Market Simulation Tool}} for {{Future Grid Scenario Analysis}}},
  volume = {10},
  issn = {1949-3061},
  abstract = {This paper proposes a computationally efficient electricity market simulation tool (MST) suitable for future grid scenario analysis. The market model is based on a unit commitment (UC) problem and takes into account the uptake of emerging technologies, like demand response, battery storage, concentrated solar thermal generation, and HVDC transmission. To allow for a subsequent stability assessment, the MST requires an explicit representation of the number of online generation units, which affects power system inertia and reactive power support capability. These requirements render a fullfledged UC model computationally intractable, so we propose unit clustering, a rolling horizon approach, and constraint clipping to increase the computational efficiency. To showcase the capability of the proposed tool, we use a simplified model of the Australian National Electricity Market with different penetrations of renewable generation. The results are verified by a comparison to a more expressive and computationally intensive binary UC, which confirm the validity of the approach for long term future grid studies.},
